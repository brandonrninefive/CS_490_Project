CS 490 Online IDE
======

A completely free online IDE with real-time code sharing between peers, a built in chat system, GitHub integration, and a built-in file system for creating and managing projects. 

While online IDEs similar to this currently exist on the market, many of the better ones charge money for their services. What makes our online IDE unique is the fact that it uses a custom-built Node.js server package to provide all of our services free of charge. Simply have one person download the server package with npm, run it, and you and your peers can easily connect to it and begin collaborating in minutes!

======

- [ ] Design a sleek front-end.
