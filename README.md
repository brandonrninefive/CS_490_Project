prIDE
======

A completely free online IDE with real-time code sharing between peers, a built in chat system, GitHub integration, and a built-in file system for creating and managing projects. 

While online IDEs similar to this currently exist on the market, many of the better ones charge money for their services. What makes our online IDE unique is the fact that it uses a custom-built Node.js server package to provide all of our services free of charge. Simply have one person download the server package with npm, run it, and you and your peers can easily connect to it and begin collaborating in minutes!  

Why is it called prIDE? While brainstorming names for the project, we decided that the name prIDE would not only be catchy, but would also allow us to shed light on a cause that we all believe in, LGBT equality. We hope that while using prIDE, you will take the time to read up on, and possibly donate to, the activist organization GLAAD (linked on our front-end), which works closely with the community and media to educate the public on LGBT rights and issues.

Semester To-do List:
======

- [x] Design a sleek front-end (ongoing, but nice enough for this semester's accomplishment list).
- [x] Replace input alert boxes with nicer alternatives.
- [ ] Clean up, refactor, and comment out code for cleanliness.
- [x] Create Node.js websocket server application with a simple project filesystem.
- [x] Communicate with the Node.js server from the front-end to display projects and files for editing.
- [x] Implement a simple chat system between users for collaboration.
- [x] Implement a code sharing feature to allow others to view or perform code updates on the same file at the same time.
- [x] Implement git/Github integration.
